/**
 * A content provider loads content upon [provider request]. Loading the actual content
 * is handled by subclasses of ContentProvider in the load method. Once content was
 * loaded, it is only reloaded if the content is cleared with [provider clear] or refreshed
 * with [provider refresh].
 *
 * The content might be available immediately or later, depending on the concrete provider
 * class. Users should always observe the content property to get notified when content
 * gets available therefore.
 *
 * If an error occurs while loading, a content := nil change event will be fired and provider.error
 * will be set to the NSError object. Before using the content, this should be checked and handled.
 *
 * Content can be processed using filters (see addFilter:).
 * Content providers can have dependencies to other content providers (see addDependency:). Only
 * when all dependencies have content available, the content provider is loaded. Errors from
 * dependencies are also errors for the content provider. If content of a dependency changes,
 * the content provider is cleared and reloaded. This behaviour can be changed by overwriting
 * onDependencyChanged: in custom implementations.
 *
 * Content provider implementors should subclass BaseContentProvider or SimpleContentProvider.
 * Protected methods for use in subclasses only provided by ContentProviderProtected.h. This
 * interface should be imported only by content provider implementors.
 *
 * Warning: Content providers are not thread-safe. All calls to content providers (requesting, refreshing,
 * providing content, ...) are supposed to happen from the same thread.

// A content filter chain can be configured for a content provider to post-process the
// original content. Any content object retrieved by the content provider should be delivered
// to the chain of content filters first and only the result of these should be delivered
// as content; the unfiltered object should never be visible externally.

// inconsistent content might be encountered otherwise.

// so that if all dependencies get available, this content provider will retrieve
// its content automatically. If one of the required content providers has an error, it will
// be set on this content provider as well.
//
// Dependencies should be configured before any content is requested, errors or
// inconsistent content might be encountered otherwise.
//
// This can be used to configure content providers so that they will wait for other content
// providers, f.e. to wait for a login session to be available before performing requests. It also
// can be used in custom content provider implementations to wait for other content providers.
